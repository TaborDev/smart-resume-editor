# Smart Resume Editor - Session Status (Sept 21, 2025)

## ✅ Completed Today
- Implemented PROMPTS.md sections 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2
- Fixed Chrome extension manifest.json and webpack configuration  
- Job detection working on LinkedIn and Indeed
- CSS extraction and side panel UI properly configured
- Extension builds successfully with `pnpm build`

## 🚧 Current Issue
- Chrome aggressively caching old manifest.json 
- Hundreds of `chrome-extension://invalid/` errors persist
- Manifest files are correct, but Chrome won't read updated version

## 🔄 Tomorrow's Tasks
1. **Force Chrome Cache Clear** (CRITICAL)
   - Remove "Smart Resume Editor" from chrome://extensions/ (trash icon)
   - Close ALL Chrome windows
   - Restart Chrome completely
   - Reinstall from: `/Users/taweraradomkidanu/smart-resume-editor/chrome-extension/dist`
   - Look for "Smart Resume Editor v2" (renamed to force fresh install)

2. **Test Side Panel Functionality**
   - Verify chrome-extension://invalid/ errors are gone
   - Test side panel opens correctly
   - Test job analysis, LaTeX editor, AI suggestions panels

## 📁 Key Files Status
- ✅ `/chrome-extension/dist/manifest.json` - Fixed (only icons/* in web_accessible_resources)
- ✅ `/chrome-extension/content-scripts/job-detector.ts` - Working correctly
- ✅ `/chrome-extension/sidebar/` - React components with proper CSS
- ✅ `/chrome-extension/webpack.config.js` - MiniCssExtractPlugin configured

## 🏗️ Build Command
```bash
cd /Users/taweraradomkidanu/smart-resume-editor/chrome-extension
pnpm build
```

## 🎯 Next Session Goal
Get past the Chrome caching issue and test the actual side panel UI functionality.
